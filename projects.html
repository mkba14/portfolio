                   To be honest, I'm a little confused about what kinds of projects
                are expected to be entered in here.  If the desired outcome is
                just a list of things I have used programming for, I will state them here.

                   A few years ago, I was an intern at the NASA Ames Research Center.  
                As part of the project I was interning for, I ended up learning some self-taught
                web-scraping and pandas in python.  It was fun, and I learned that I enjoy being
                behind a computer for hours on end.
