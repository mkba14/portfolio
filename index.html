                <!--My name is Makenzie and I enjoy reading and writing.  I also enjoy the sciences and have relativly
                recently discovered that I have fun writing computer code.-->
                When I was younger, I never wanted
                to touch anything resembling computer code.  I had an innate fear that I would accidentally 
                break the computer through creating a virus or something.  When I applied to college, I 
                went into physics thinking that it would be fun. In physics, as with the majority of 
                mathematical sciences, learning how to write basic computer code is a must.  As one of my
                professors once pointed out, all the problems that can be solved by hand already have been.
                As such, I learned some basic python.  I enjoyed learning it so much that I branched out to 
                learning a bit of C++.  I even applied to a NASA internship with the express interest in obtaining
                more coding experience.
                <br>
                </br>
                As it turns out, I enjoy coding.  It is fun to be able to write a line and see the magic of
                having the computer act it out.  I believed that because of this, I would enjoy computational 
                physics and modeling.  I very much dislike that aspect.  I am trying now to branch out and 
                study other computer-related courses.  I enjoy refactoring code to work better.  
                I also enjoy just trying to write it out.  Let's see if this class is a good fit for me.
